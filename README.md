This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to install necessary dependencies for the application being built. The initial `Dockerfile` attempts to run unit tests using `unittest`, but fails because the `unittest` module is missing. The `Dockerfile_solution` shows the corrected version, which includes installing the required `unittest` module and any project-specific dependencies by using a requirements file or explicitly listing the packages in the `RUN` command.
